# Sketch-spelling-check

Check spelling of your text layers directly from Sketch. Just run the plugin once. The plugin is using OSX's own dictionary to check for spelling mistakes.

# Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/saranshsolanki/Sketch-spelling-check/archive/master.zip) this plugin 
2. Double click the plugin file to automatically install
3. The shortcut should now be available under the Plugin's menu in Sketch


# Usage
1. Make a selection anywhere on the Sketch file you wish to check for spelling mistakes.
2. Run **Spelling Check** from the Plugin's menu or run **(ctrl shift g)**
3. The text with wrong spellings will be highlighted with a red color.

# Next steps
1. I'm working on a way to add another fill color to the wrongly spelt text layers, without overwriting the existing style.
2. Show suggestions for the wrongly spelt words.
3. Auto-correct some of the wrongly spelt words.
